For my second project I am creating an app that tradespeople and businesses that offer services/home visits can use to log their billable time. 

For example, A gardener does a visit at a clients property and that staff member needs to report back to the accounts team how long they spent onsite and where they were for the accounts team to invoice the client.

The staff member will need to first log in to the app to access the timesheet. Once logged in they will be presented with input boxes with the following options: Client Name, Date Visited, Time arrived, Time left & Notes from the visit once the staff member clicks the submit button they will see a pop up that says the form has been sumbitted sucessfully.
